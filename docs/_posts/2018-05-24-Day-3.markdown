title: Day 3

This is actually Day 4. I spent most of Day 3 trying to get the devlog on Github. I thought I had it on Day 2, but the layout wasn't working. I spent some 3 hours trying various things until I found post saying I had to fix configuration file. It would have been lovely if this was on the Jekyll website, but sometimes you just have to take what you get. Well, that happened.

I began today finishing the boards page. The button's size should be consistent with the size of posts. The posts also should navigate correctly now; that is, when I set-up the posts page.

I also began and hopefully finished the sign in page. This was just typical form stuff. It was difficult at all. I followed my page creation plan that I discussed in my previous page. It seemed pretty useful, although, this page is too short to make any final conclusions.

The only real issue I had was deciding whether I should style the page with mostly with bootstrap's class configurations or typical CSS. Turns out, this does not really matter since the page is really short. 

My Java UI experience is really coming in handy!
