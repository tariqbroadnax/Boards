title: Day 4 and 5

Lots of progress. Lots learned.

I installed XAMPP. I remember moving very slowly in my previous back-end project because I often switched between 3-5 apps. In contrast, XAMPP makes my workflow much more smooth because many operations are grouped into a simple client app and a configuration website. My only complaint is that XAMPP's MySQL interface, as a programmer with a little database experience, felt a little confusing.

I also installed Brackets since I cannot quickly edit and test PHP files with an online editor. Its very pretty.

Using XAMPP, I began setting up my database. So far, I have tables for posts and comments.

With my post table set up, I edited the PHP homepage to display them. I also programmed the sort links, using query parameters.

The most important change, however, was the programming of the show more button. Working on it has revealed something extremely important to me. Previously, I thought PHP files could only load web-pages. However, PHP files can load any type of text and it doesn't have to be used as web-pages. Using AJAX, I can load text and use the data however I want. 

This got me thinking about the best way to send the data. Usually, I send data essentially as CSV files (but without the commas). It is a simple and quick way to display database information. However, I wanted to challenge myself and knew that I would eventually be working with hierarchical data. And so I looked into JSON. I remember reading somewhere that JSON is the de facto way to send data over the internet. And now I see why. The format and the built parsing support on the frontend and backend makes sharing data really simple.

Given this, my show more button works as follows. It requests a PHP page. The PHP page sends the data as JSON. The client parses the JSON and uses the corresponding data to show more posts.

Outside of my homepage or board page, I continued working on other pages that involved the creation and recovery of an account. However, I haven't yet programmed the back-end side of this. This will be my first time working with forms and so I am little scared. I hope my website does not get hacked. x.x.

While my abundant files, I decided to organize my project a little. I store css file in a style folder. And I store scripts in a script folder. Again, I remember seeing this somewhere and decided to copy. 

I wanted to finish the project today, but it is proving more difficult that I had previously anticipated. I am definitely learning a lot but I do not want to work on this too long. I want to finish many more projects before I croak. And so, I hope to finish within the next 2 days; that is, before Thursday. Hopefully my new todo lists help me move a little more quickly.
